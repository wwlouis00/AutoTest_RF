DFS (Dynamic Frequency Selection) is a wireless communication technology primarily used in **5GHz bands** within Wi-Fi 5 (802.11ac) and Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) standards.  
It allows wireless devices to dynamically adjust channels within certain frequency ranges to avoid interfering with radar systems or other protected communication equipment.

## **Key Features of DFS Channels**
1. **Radar Interference Avoidance**:  
   - In some countries, parts of the 5GHz band are shared with weather radar, military radar, and other systems.  
   - DFS monitors radar signals and automatically switches channels when necessary, ensuring critical systems are not affected.  

2. **Extended Wi-Fi Channel Range**:  
   - Non-DFS channels (e.g., 36, 40, 44, 48) are always available but limited in number.  
   - Enabling DFS opens additional channels (e.g., 52–64 and 100–144), reducing congestion and improving network performance.  

3. **Dynamic Channel Switching Mechanism**:  
   - Before enabling a DFS channel, the router or AP (Access Point) performs a **Channel Availability Check (CAC)**, which can last from 60 seconds up to 10 minutes, ensuring no radar signals are present.  
   - If radar is detected during operation, Wi-Fi will **switch to another channel within 10 seconds**, potentially causing a brief network interruption.  

## **Pros and Cons of DFS Channels**
| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Expands available 5GHz channels, reducing congestion | Routers take longer to switch or start DFS channels |
| Reduces interference from other Wi-Fi devices | Some devices (older smart appliances, game consoles) may not support DFS |
| Improves Wi-Fi stability and performance | Radar interference may force channel changes, impacting stability |

## **Which Devices Support DFS?**
- **Most high-end Wi-Fi 5 / Wi-Fi 6 routers** support DFS, but settings may need to be enabled manually.  
- **Laptops and smartphones** (with Wi-Fi 6 support) generally connect to DFS channels, but some **older IoT devices may not**.  

## **How to Check or Configure DFS Channels**
1. Log in to your router’s admin interface (usually `192.168.1.1`).  
2. Find **Wi-Fi channel settings** and select the 5GHz band.  
3. If supported, choose a DFS channel (e.g., 52, 100, 116).  
4. Save settings. The router may require CAC time before the channel becomes active.  

## **Who Should Use DFS Channels?**
- **Users in high-density apartments or office environments**, where 5GHz channels are crowded.  
- **Wi-Fi 6 router owners**, aiming to optimize connection quality.  
- **Users not sensitive to brief disconnections**, such as for downloads or streaming (real-time gaming may be affected).  

If your Wi-Fi often suffers from interference or congestion on the 5GHz band, enabling DFS could significantly improve connection quality!
